Week 12

- Face with a puzzling problem, what do you do?
  - Split it in smaller problems?
  - Find pattern?
  - Make a plan?
  - Look for things that changes?

- When you start losing focus, what does your brain try to do?
  - Is it wanting an easy fix (cellphone, notifications addiction? Eating? moving?)
  - Do you feel like talking to others?
  - Are you trying to find strategies to not do the work?

Don't feed it, but don't try to control it. Just observe that you are losing focus.

To help your mind to get back on track do simple challenges:
ie.: Find five words that starts with the letter "i". Find a city that start with the letter "L", etc.
